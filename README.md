# Jefferson Trail Game

A game in the Processing IDE for python that depicts the novel As I Lay Dying in way as to recreate Oregon Trail (except this game is not diffucalt as it was an English project). There is the main game plays more like a movie where you watch what goes on, but you can interact with the characters, and see some dialogue. 

The minigames are kinda silly, but they just give a more interactive way to play through a certain part of the story.

Much of the code is a complete hack as this was my first big programming project. Many improvements can be made (splitting the single file into multiple files, getting rid of many temporary variables, etc.)
