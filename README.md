# Jefferson Trail Game

A game in the Processing IDE for python that depicts the novel As I Lay Dying in way as to recreate Oregon Trail (except this game is not diffucalt as it was an English project). There is the main game plays more like a movie where you watch what goes on, but you can interact with the characters, and see some dialogue. 

The minigames are kinda silly, but they just give a more interactive way to play through a certain part of the story.

Much of the code is a complete hack as this was my first big programming project. Many improvements can be made (splitting the single file into multiple files, getting rid of many temporary variables, etc.)

From there you can talk to the family, check a map, or check the health of each of your party members.
