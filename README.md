# Jefferson Trail Game

A game in the Processing IDE for python that depicts the novel As I Lay Dying in way as to recreate Oregon Trail (except this game is not diffucalt as it was an English project). There is the main game plays more like a movie where you watch what goes on, but you can interact with the characters, and see some dialogue. 

The minigames are kinda silly, but they just give a more interactive way to play through a certain part of the story.

Much of the code is a complete hack as this was my first big programming project. Many improvements can be made (splitting the single file into multiple files, getting rid of many temporary variables, etc.). One thing to note is that this project pushes the capibilities of Processing to the limit, so issues can arise when editing the file.


# Running the Game
To run the game, you need to install the processing IDE. Also, make sure to install the sound library by the Processing Foundation in order to run the game.

Once everything is installed, put the Game.pyde file in the same directory as the data folder. Next, open Game.pyde, and run the file from the IDE. A window should pop up with the title screen. Type in your option, and press enter to begin!

From there you can talk to the family, check a map, or check the health of each of your party members.
